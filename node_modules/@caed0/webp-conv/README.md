![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/d18m/%40caed0%2Fwebp-conv?style=for-the-badge)


webp-conv is a Node.js module for converting both animated and static WebP files to GIF or PNG format. This tool leverages the powerful libwebp library to provide high-quality conversions. With this tool, you can easily convert your WebP images, making it a convenient solution for your image conversion needs.


## Installation

You can install webp-conv using npm:

```bash
npm install @caed0/webp-conv
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use webp-conv in your Node.js project:

```javascript
const webpconv = require('@caed0/webp-conv');
const converter = new webpconv();

const input = 'input.webp';
const output = 'output.gif';

converter.convert(input, output, { quality: 10, transparent: '0x000000' });
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to convert a list of input WebP files to GIF or PNG format, specifying output quality and transparency settings. The converted files will be saved in the specified output folder.

## Parameters

The `convert` method takes the following parameters:

- `input`: The path to the input WebP file you want to convert.
- `output`: The path where the converted file will be saved.
- `options` (optional): An object containing additional options for the conversion (only apply if the output is an gif).
    - `quality`: The quality of the output image (0-100). Higher values result in better quality, but larger file sizes. (`Default: 10`)
    - `transparent`: A string specifying the transparency color in hexadecimal format (e.g., '0xRRGGBB' or '0xRRGGBBAA'). This option is only applicable to conversions with transperent background. (`Default: 0x000000`)

## Dependencies
