1mNAME0m
       vwebp - decompress a WebP file and display it in a window

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mvwebp 22m[4moptions24m] 4minput_file.webp0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       This manual page documents the 1mvwebp 22mcommand.

       1mvwebp  22mdecompresses  a  WebP  file  and  displays  it in a window using
       OpenGL.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-h     22mPrint usage summary.

       1m-version0m
              Print version number and exit.

       1m-noicc 22mDon't use the ICC profile if present.

       1m-nofancy0m
              Don't use the fancy YUV420 upscaler.

       1m-nofilter0m
              Disable in-loop filtering.

       1m-dither 4m22mstrength0m
              Specify a dithering 1mstrength 22mbetween 0 and 100. Dithering  is  a
              post-processing  effect  applied  to  chroma components in lossy
              compression.  It helps by smoothing gradients and avoiding band-
              ing artifacts. Default: 50.

       1m-noalphadither0m
              By default, quantized transparency planes  are  dithered  during
              decompression,  to  smooth the gradients. This flag will prevent
              this dithering.

       1m-usebgcolor0m
              Fill transparent areas with the bitstream's own background color
              instead of checkerboard only. Default is white for  non-animated
              images.

       1m-mt    22mUse multi-threading for decoding, if possible.

       1m-info  22mDisplay image information on top of the decoded image.

       1m-- 4m22mstring0m
              Explicitly  specify the input file. This option is useful if the
              input file starts with an '-' for instance. This option must ap-
              pear 1mlast22m.  Any other options afterward will be ignored. If  the
              input file is "-", the data will be read from 4mstdin24m instead of a
              file.

       1mKEYBOARD SHORTCUTS0m

       1m'c'    22mToggle use of color profile.

       1m'b'    22mToggle display of background color.

       1m'i'    22mOverlay file information.

       1m'd'    22mDisable blending and disposal process, for debugging purposes.

       1m'q' / 'Q' / ESC0m
              Quit.


1mEXIT STATUS0m
       If  there were no problems during execution, 1mvwebp 22mexits with the value
       of the C constant 1mEXIT_SUCCESS22m. This is usually zero.

       If an error occurs, 1mvwebp 22mexits  with  the  value  of  the  C  constant
       1mEXIT_FAILURE22m. This is usually one.


1mEXAMPLES0m
