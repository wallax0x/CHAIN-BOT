1mDESCRIPTION0m
       This manual page documents the 1mwebpmux 22mcommand.

       1mwebpmux 22mcan be used to create/extract from animated WebP files, as well
       as to add/extract/strip XMP/EXIF metadata and ICC profile.  If a single
       file name (not starting with the character '-') is supplied as the  ar-
       gument,  the  command  line  arguments are actually tokenized from this
       file.  This allows for easy scripting or using a large number of  argu-
       ments.

1mOPTIONS0m
   1mGET_OPTIONS (-get):0m
       1micc    22mGet ICC profile.

       1mexif   22mGet EXIF metadata.

       1mxmp    22mGet XMP metadata.

       1mframe 4m22mn0m
              Get nth frame from an animated image. (n = 0 has a special mean-
              ing: last frame).


   1mSET_OPTIONS (-set)0m
       1mloop 4m22mloop_count0m
              Set loop count on an animated file.

       Where: 'loop_count' must be in range [0, 65535].

       1mbgcolor 4m22mA,R,G,B0m
              Set the background color of the canvas on an animated file.

       where:  'A', 'R', 'G' and 'B' are integers in the range 0 to 255 speci-
       fying the Alpha, Red, Green and Blue component values respectively.

       1micc 4m22mfile.icc0m
              Set ICC profile.

       Where: 'file.icc' contains the ICC profile to be set.

       1mexif 4m22mfile.exif0m
              Set EXIF metadata.

       Where: 'file.exif' contains the EXIF metadata to be set.

       1mxmp 4m22mfile.xmp0m
              Set XMP metadata.

       Where: 'file.xmp' contains the XMP metadata to be set.


   1mSTRIP_OPTIONS (-strip)0m
       1micc    22mStrip ICC profile.

       1mexif   22mStrip EXIF metadata.

       1mxmp    22mStrip XMP metadata.


   1mDURATION_OPTIONS (-duration)0m
       Amend the duration of a specific interval of  frames.  This  option  is
       only  effective  on  animated  WebP and has no effect on a single-frame
       file.

       4mduration[,start[,end]]0m
              Where:
              1mduration 22mis  the  duration  for  the  interval  in  milliseconds
              (mandatory).  Must be non-negative.
              1mstart 22mis the starting frame index of the interval (optional).
              1mend  22mis  the ending frame index (inclusive) of the interval (op-
              tional).

       The three typical usages of this option are:
              1m-duration d0m
                   set the duration to 'd' for the whole animation.
              1m-duration d,f0m
                   set the duration of frame 'f' to 'd'.
              1m-duration d,start,end0m
                   set the duration to 'd' for the whole [start,end] interval.

              Note that the frames outside of the [start, end] interval will
              remain untouched.
              The 'end' value '0' has the special meaning 'last frame  of  the
              animation'.

       4mReminder:0m
              frame indexing starts at '1'.


   1mFRAME_OPTIONS (-frame)0m
       Create an animated WebP file from multiple (non-animated) WebP images.

       4mfile_i24m 4m+di[+xi+yi[+mi[bi]]]0m
              Where: 'file_i' is the i'th frame (WebP format), 'xi','yi' spec-
              ify  the image offset for this frame, 'di' is the pause duration
              before next frame, 'mi' is the dispose method for this frame  (0
              for  NONE  or  1 for BACKGROUND) and 'bi' is the blending method
              for this frame (+b for BLEND or -b for NO_BLEND).  Argument 'bi'
              can be omitted and will default to +b (BLEND).  Also,  'mi'  can
              be omitted if 'bi' is omitted and will default to 0 (NONE).  Fi-
              nally,  if  'mi'  and 'bi' are omitted then 'xi' and 'yi' can be
              omitted and will default to +0+0.

       1m-loop 4m22mn0m
              Loop the frames n number of times. 0 indicates the frames should
              loop forever.  Valid range is 0  to  65535  [Default:  0  (infi-
              nite)].

       1m-bgcolor 4m22mA,R,G,B0m
              Background color of the canvas.
              where:  'A', 'R', 'G' and 'B' are integers in the range 0 to 255
              specifying the Alpha, Red, Green and Blue component  values  re-
              spectively [Default: 255,255,255,255].


   1mINPUT0m
       Input file in WebP format.


   1mOUTPUT (-o)0m
       Output file in WebP format.


   1mNote:0m
       The nature of EXIF, XMP and ICC data is not checked and is assumed to
       be valid.


1mEXIT STATUS0m
       If  there  were  no  problems  during execution, 1mwebpmux 22mexits with the
       value of the C constant 1mEXIT_SUCCESS22m. This is usually zero.

       If an error occurs, 1mwebpmux 22mexits with the  value  of  the  C  constant
       1mEXIT_FAILURE22m. This is usually one.


1mEXAMPLES0m
       Add ICC profile:
       webpmux -set icc image_profile.icc in.webp -o icc_container.webp

       Extract ICC profile:
       webpmux -get icc icc_container.webp -o image_profile.icc

       Strip ICC profile:
       webpmux -strip icc icc_container.webp -o without_icc.webp

       Add XMP metadata:
       webpmux -set xmp image_metadata.xmp in.webp -o xmp_container.webp

       Extract XMP metadata:
       webpmux -get xmp xmp_container.webp -o image_metadata.xmp

       Strip XMP metadata:
       webpmux -strip xmp xmp_container.webp -o without_xmp.webp

       Add EXIF metadata:
       webpmux -set exif image_metadata.exif in.webp -o exif_container.webp

       Extract EXIF metadata:
       webpmux -get exif exif_container.webp -o image_metadata.exif

       Strip EXIF metadata:
       webpmux -strip exif exif_container.webp -o without_exif.webp

       Create an animated WebP file from 3 (non-animated) WebP images:
       webpmux -frame 1.webp +100 -frame 2.webp +100+50+50
               -frame 3.webp +100+50+50+1+b -loop 10 -bgcolor 255,255,255,255
               -o anim_container.webp

       Get the 2nd frame from an animated WebP file:
       webpmux -get frame 2 anim_container.webp -o frame_2.webp

       Using -get/-set/-strip with input file name starting with '-':
       webpmux -set icc image_profile.icc -o icc_container.webp -- ---in.webp
       webpmux -get icc -o image_profile.icc -- ---icc_container.webp
       webpmux -strip icc -o without_icc.webp -- ---icc_container.webp
