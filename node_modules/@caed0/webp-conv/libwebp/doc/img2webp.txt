1mNAME0m
       img2webp - create animated WebP file from a sequence of input images.

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mimg2webp 22m[file_options] [[frame_options] frame_file]... [-o webp_file]
       1mimg2webp argument_file_name0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       This manual page documents the 1mimg2webp 22mcommand.

       1mimg2webp  22mcompresses  a sequence of images using the animated WebP for-
       mat.  Input images can either be PNG, JPEG, TIFF or WebP.  If a  single
       file  name (not starting with the character '-') is supplied as the ar-
       gument, the command line arguments are  actually  tokenized  from  this
       file.   This allows for easy scripting or using a large number of argu-
       ments.

1mFILE-LEVEL OPTIONS0m
       The file-level options are applied at the beginning of the  compression
       process, before the input frames are read.

       1m-o 4m22mstring0m
              Specify the name of the output WebP file.

       1m-min_size0m
              Encode  images to achieve smallest size. This disables key frame
              insertion and picks the parameters  resulting  in  the  smallest
              output  for each frame. It uses lossless compression by default,
              but can be combined with -q, -m, -lossy or -mixed options.

       1m-kmin 4m22mint0m

       1m-kmax 4m22mint0m
              Specify the minimum and maximum distance between consecutive key
              frames (independently decodable frames) in the output animation.
              The tool will insert some key frames into the  output  animation
              as needed so that this criteria is satisfied.
              1m-mixed 22mMixed compression mode: optimize compression of the image
              by  picking  either lossy or lossless compression for each frame
              heuristically. This global  option  disables  the  local  option
              1m-lossy 22mand 1m-lossless 22m.

       1m-near_lossless 4m22mint0m
              Specify the level of near-lossless image preprocessing. This op-
              tion adjusts pixel values to help compressibility, but has mini-
              mal  impact on the visual quality. It triggers lossless compres-
              sion mode automatically. The range is 0 (maximum  preprocessing)
              to  100  (no  preprocessing,  the default). The typical value is
              around 60. Note that lossy with 1m-q 100 22mcan at times yield better
              results.

       1m-sharp_yuv0m
              Use more accurate and sharper  RGB->YUV  conversion.  Note  that
              this  process is slower than the default 'fast' RGB->YUV conver-
              sion.

       1m-loop 4m22mint0m
              Specifies the number of times the animation should  loop.  Using
              '0' means 'loop indefinitely'.

       1m-v     22mBe more verbose.

       1m-h, -help0m
              A short usage summary.

       1m-version0m
              Print the version numbers of the relevant libraries used.


1mPER-FRAME OPTIONS0m
       The per-frame options are applied for the images following as arguments
       in the command line. They can be modified any number of times preceding
       each particular input image.

       1m-d 4m22mint24m Specify the image duration in milliseconds.

       1m-lossless, -lossy0m
              Compress  the  next image(s) using lossless or lossy compression
              mode. The default mode is lossless.

       1m-q 4m22mfloat0m
              Specify the compression factor between 0 and 100. The default is
              75.

       1m-m 4m22mint24m Specify the compression method to use. This  parameter  controls
              the  trade  off  between  encoding speed and the compressed file
              size and quality.  Possible values range from 0  to  6.  Default
              value is 4.  When higher values are used, the encoder will spend
              more  time  inspecting additional encoding possibilities and de-
              cide on the quality gain.  Lower value can result in faster pro-
              cessing time at the expense of larger file size and  lower  com-
              pression quality.

       1m-exact, -noexact0m
              Preserve or alter RGB values in transparent area. The default is
              1m-noexact22m, to help compressibility. Note 1m-noexact 22mmay cause arti-
              facts in frames compressed with 1m-lossy22m.


1mEXIT STATUS0m
       If  there  were  no  problems during execution, 1mimg2webp 22mexits with the
       value of the C constant 1mEXIT_SUCCESS22m. This is usually zero.

       If an error occurs, 1mimg2webp 22mexits with the value  of  the  C  constant
       1mEXIT_FAILURE22m. This is usually one.


1mEXAMPLE0m
       img2webp -loop 2 in0.png -lossy in1.jpg -d 80 in2.tiff -o out.webp
