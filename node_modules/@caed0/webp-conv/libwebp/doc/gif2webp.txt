1mDESCRIPTION0m
       This manual page documents the 1mgif2webp 22mcommand.

       1mgif2webp 22mconverts a GIF image to a WebP image.

1mOPTIONS0m
       The basic options are:

       1m-o 4m22mstring0m
              Specify  the  name of the output WebP file. If omitted, 1mgif2webp0m
              will perform conversion but only report statistics.   Using  "-"
              as output name will direct output to 'stdout'.

       1m-- 4m22mstring0m
              Explicitly  specify the input file. This option is useful if the
              input file starts with an '-' for instance. This option must ap-
              pear 1mlast22m.  Any other options afterward will be ignored. If  the
              input file is "-", the data will be read from 4mstdin24m instead of a
              file.

       1m-h, -help0m
              Usage information.

       1m-version0m
              Print the version number (as major.minor.revision) and exit.

       1m-lossy 22mEncode the image using lossy compression.

       1m-mixed 22mMixed  compression  mode:  optimize  compression of the image by
              picking either lossy or  lossless  compression  for  each  frame
              heuristically.

       1m-near_lossless 4m22mint0m
              Specify the level of near-lossless image preprocessing. This op-
              tion adjusts pixel values to help compressibility, but has mini-
              mal  impact on the visual quality. It triggers lossless compres-
              sion mode automatically. The range is 0 (maximum  preprocessing)
              to  100  (no  preprocessing,  the default). The typical value is
              around 60. Note that lossy with 1m-q 100 22mcan at times yield better
              results.

       1m-sharp_yuv0m
              Use more accurate and sharper  RGB->YUV  conversion.  Note  that
              this  process is slower than the default 'fast' RGB->YUV conver-
              sion.

       1m-q 4m22mfloat0m
              Specify the compression factor for RGB channels  between  0  and
              100. The default is 75.
              In  case  of  lossless compression (default), a small factor en-
              ables faster compression speed, but produces a larger file. Max-
              imum compression is achieved by using a value of 100.
              In case of lossy compression (specified by the -lossy option), a
              small factor produces a smaller file with  lower  quality.  Best
              quality is achieved by using a value of 100.

       1m-m 4m22mint24m Specify  the  compression method to use. This parameter controls
              the trade off between encoding speed  and  the  compressed  file
              size  and  quality.   Possible values range from 0 to 6. Default
              value is 4.  When higher values are used, the encoder will spend
              more time inspecting additional encoding possibilities  and  de-
              cide on the quality gain.  Lower value can result is faster pro-
              cessing  time  at the expense of larger file size and lower com-
              pression quality.

       1m-min_size0m
              Encode image to achieve smallest size. This disables  key  frame
              insertion and picks the dispose method resulting in the smallest
              output  for each frame. It uses lossless compression by default,
              but can be combined with -q, -m, -lossy or -mixed options.

       1m-kmin 4m22mint0m

       1m-kmax 4m22mint0m
              Specify the minimum and maximum distance between consecutive key
              frames (independently decodable frames) in the output animation.
              The tool will insert some key frames into the  output  animation
              as needed so that this criteria is satisfied.
              A  'kmax'  value  of  0 will turn off insertion of key frames. A
              'kmax' value of 1 will result in all frames  being  key  frames.
              'kmin'  value  is  not  taken into account in both these special
              cases.  Typical values are in the range 3 to 30. Default  values
              are  kmin  = 9, kmax = 17 for lossless compression and kmin = 3,
              kmax = 5 for lossy compression.
              These two options are relevant only  for  animated  images  with
              large number of frames (>50).
              When lower values are used, more frames will be converted to key
              frames.  This  may  lead to smaller number of frames required to
              decode a frame on average, thereby improving the  decoding  per-
              formance.  But  this  may  lead  to  slightly bigger file sizes.
              Higher values  may  lead  to  worse  decoding  performance,  but
              smaller file sizes.
              Some restrictions:
              (i) kmin < kmax,
              (ii) kmin >= kmax / 2 + 1 and
              (iii) kmax - kmin <= 30.
              If  any of these restrictions are not met, they will be enforced
              automatically.

       1m-metadata 4m22mstring0m
              A comma separated list of metadata to copy from the input to the
              output if present.  Valid values: 1mall22m, 1mnone22m, 1micc22m, 1mxmp22m.  The  de-
              fault is 1mxmp22m.

       1m-f 4m22mint24m For  lossy encoding only (specified by the -lossy option). Spec-
              ify the strength of the deblocking filter, between 0 (no filter-
              ing) and 100 (maximum filtering).  A value of 0  will  turn  off
              any  filtering.  Higher  value will increase the strength of the
              filtering process applied after decoding the picture. The higher
              the value the smoother the picture will appear.  Typical  values
              are usually in the range of 20 to 50.

       1m-mt    22mUse multi-threading for encoding, if possible.

       1m-loop_compatibility0m
              If  enabled, handle the loop information in a compatible fashion
              for Chrome version prior to M62 (inclusive) and Firefox.

       1m-v     22mPrint extra information.

       1m-quiet 22mDo not print anything.


1mEXIT STATUS0m
       If there were no problems during execution,  1mgif2webp  22mexits  with  the
       value of the C constant 1mEXIT_SUCCESS22m. This is usually zero.

       If  an  error  occurs,  1mgif2webp 22mexits with the value of the C constant
       1mEXIT_FAILURE22m. This is usually one.
