# npm resolution error report

While resolving: @whiskeysockets/baileys@6.7.18
Found: sharp@0.34.2
node_modules/sharp
  sharp@"^0.34.2" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peerOptional sharp@"^0.32.6" from @whiskeysockets/baileys@6.7.18
node_modules/@whiskeysockets/baileys
  @whiskeysockets/baileys@"^6.7.18" from the root project

Conflicting peer dependency: sharp@0.32.6
node_modules/sharp
  peerOptional sharp@"^0.32.6" from @whiskeysockets/baileys@6.7.18
  node_modules/@whiskeysockets/baileys
    @whiskeysockets/baileys@"^6.7.18" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
